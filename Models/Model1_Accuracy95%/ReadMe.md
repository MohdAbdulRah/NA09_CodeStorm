## üöÄ Usage

Here are the steps to use this model (assuming integration into a larger app or script):

1. **Preprocess an image**  
   - Resize / rescale leaf image to match model‚Äôs input shape (e.g., 224√ó224 or 256√ó256).  
   - Normalize pixel values (e.g. /255), possibly apply augmentations if needed.

2. **Load the model**  
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

   model = load_model("Model1_Accuracy95%/model1.h5")
Predict

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from utils import preprocess_image, load_class_names

img = preprocess_image("path/to/leaf.jpg")
preds = model.predict(np.expand_dims(img, axis=0))
class_names = load_class_names("Model1_Accuracy95%/training_hist.json")

predicted_class = class_names[np.argmax(preds)]
confidence = float(np.max(preds))
print(f"Disease: {predicted_class}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}")

### üîç Model Details
