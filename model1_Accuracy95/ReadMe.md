 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/MohdAbdulRah/NA09_CodeStorm.git
cd PlantDiseasePredicton/model1_Accuracy95

### 2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py

### 5️⃣ Open in Browser

Streamlit will display a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501). Open it to use the app.

### 📸 Usage

Click Browse files to upload a clear photo of a plant leaf.

Wait for the AI model to analyze the image.

View the predicted disease, confidence score, and treatment suggestions.

### 📊 Model Details

Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Accuracy: 95% on test dataset

Trained using a publicly available plant disease dataset.

### 🌟 Future Improvements

Expand the model to cover more plant species.

Add multi-language support for farmers worldwide.

Integrate weather and soil data for advanced predictions.
